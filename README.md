##Who is the app for
* This parking spot sharing app is build for two major groups of users:
    1. Those who drive to work or school where *parking are limited or pricy*.
    2. Those who are *seeking storage space for their vehicle(s)* during vacations or away from home where indoor parkings are not available.

## Motivation
* The inspiration for ReParked came from a real life exprience of one of our developers. He was very excited to begin the immersive coding program, but he did have one serious concern. He lives in San Jose and was planning to drive to the campus in Berkeley and was very worried that he would make the long commute only to have difficulty finding parking! We deciced that there had to be a better solution to this all too common problem.

##Tech Used
The technologies used in creating the project were html 5, css 3, javascript, jQuery, node, express, SQL, googleAPI, sequelized npm, session storage, sha-256 encryption, Heroku, JawsDB

2. The app allows renter and host to logon their own account and _stay logged in_ during browsing session.
