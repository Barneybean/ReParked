# ReParked
** Motivation**

The inspiration for ReParked came from a real life exprience of one of our developers. He was very excited to begin the immersive coding
program, but he did have one serious concern. He lives in San Jose and was planning to drive to the campus in Berkeley and was very
worried that he would make the long commute only to have difficulty finding parking! We deciced that there had to be a better 
solution to this all too common problem.
